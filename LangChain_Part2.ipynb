Galaxy S22 Ultra Review \\n\\nSamsung's Galaxy S22 Ultra is the epitome of innovation and design in the smartphone market. As the latest flagship from the renowned Galaxy series, it blends premium features with cutting-edge technology, catering to both tech enthusiasts and the everyday user. Here's a deep dive into what makes the S22 Ultra stand out.\\n\\n#### Design and Build Quality\\n\\nThe Galaxy S22 Ultra boasts a sleek and sophisticated design, featuring a glass front and back with a metal frame.

The build quality is impeccable, offering durability without compromising on style. The phone is available in a range of colors, each adding a unique touch of elegance.\\n\\n#### Display\\n\\nSamsung has outdone itself with the S22 Ultra's Dynamic AMOLED 2X display.

The 120Hz refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling and a responsive touch interface, making it a joy to use for everything from browsing the web to watching high-definition videos.\\n\\n#### Performance\\n\\nPowered by the latest Exynos or Snapdragon chipset (depending on the region), the S22 Ultra delivers top-tier performance. With ample RAM and a robust processor, the phone handles multitasking and high-demand apps with ease. Whether it's gaming, photo editing, or running multiple apps simultaneously, the S22 Ultra performs flawlessly.\\n\\n#### Camera\\n\\nThe Galaxy S22 Ultra's camera system is a photographer's dream. The phone features a versatile array of lenses, including a wide, ultra-wide, and two telephoto lenses, offering unparalleled versatility. The 108MP main sensor captures stunning photos with rich detail, while the 100x Space Zoom brings distant subjects closer without loss of clarity. Night photography is impressive, thanks to the phone's ability to capture clear, vibrant images in low light.\\n\\n#### Battery Life and Charging\\n\\nWith a 5000mAh battery, the S22 Ultra easily lasts through a day of heavy use.

I am writing to express my concerns regarding the recent delivery of our project, which, unfortunately, has not met our agreed-upon timelines and quality expectations. As you are aware, the project delivery was delayed by two weeks, which has significantly impacted our operational planning and has had a ripple effect on our commitments to our stakeholders.\\n\\nUpon reviewing the delivered project, we have identified three major bugs that are critical to the functionality and overall performance of the software. These bugs are as follows:\\n\\n1. **Data Syncing Issue:** There is a significant problem with the data syncing mechanism, leading to loss of data between our servers and the client application.\\n2. **User Authentication Flaw:** The user authentication process has a serious vulnerability that could potentially compromise user security and privacy.\\n3. **Payment Gateway Integration Failure:** The integration with the payment gateway is not functioning correctly, preventing any transactions from being processed successfully.\\n\\nGiven the critical nature of these issues and the delay already incurred, we find ourselves in a challenging position. While we understand that unexpected hurdles can arise in software development, it is imperative that these issues are addressed with the utmost urgency to mitigate further impacts on our project timeline and quality.\\n\\nWe are willing to extend the deadline for these fixes by a maximum of 4 days from the original delivery date. This is the maximum extension we can afford without further jeopardizing our project's success and our commitments. We trust that this timeframe is sufficient for you to prioritize and resolve the identified critical bugs.\\n\\nPlease provide us with an immediate action plan, outlining how you intend to address these issues within the given timeframe. It is crucial that we have clear communication and regular updates on your progress to ensure that there are no further delays.\\n\\nWe value our partnership and are hopeful for a swift resolution to these issues. Our team is available to discuss this matter further and to provide any necessary support to facilitate these urgent fixes.\\n\\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[John Doe]\\n[Project Manager]\\n[Acme Corporation]\\n\", metadata={'source': './Mail.txt'})]\n"]}],"source":["!wget

Here\\'s my review of this delightful honey:Taste: The taste of this honey is exceptional. It has a rich and robust flavor that is both sweet and slightly tangy. You can instantly tell that it is pure and natural, without any artificial additives. The wild origin of the honey adds a unique floral note that sets it apart from regular honey varieties. It\\'s truly a treat for the taste buds.Quality: The quality of this honey is outstanding. The fact that it is organic and wild makes a noticeable difference in its taste and texture. The honey is thick and luscious, with a smooth consistency that spreads easily. It also retains all the beneficial enzymes, antioxidants, and nutrients that are often lost in processed honey. You can tell that great care has been taken in harvesting and processing this honey.Sourcing: The fact that this honey is sourced from wild bees adds to its appeal. Wild bees collect nectar from diverse and untouched floral sources, resulting in a more complex and diverse flavor profile. It gives you a sense of connection with nature, knowing that the honey comes from bees that have foraged in their natural habitat.Packaging: The packaging is simple yet elegant. The honey comes in a sturdy glass jar that preserves its freshness and allows you to see the beautiful golden color. It is also labeled with clear information about the honey\\'s organic and wild origins, which is reassuring for conscious consumers.Overall, I highly recommend Indigenous Honey. It offers a taste experience that is unmatched by regular honey varieties, thanks to its wild origin and organic quality. Whether you\\'re using it as a sweetener, spreading it on toast, or adding it to your favorite recipes, this honey is a delicious and wholesome choice. Its natural goodness and unique flavor make it a standout product in the honey market.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          31 people found this helpful\\nTop critical reviewCritical reviews› Amit Kumar Mishra1.0 out of 5 starsIt\\'s not raw honey instead, it is sugar syrupReviewed in India on 22 April 2024I recently purchased 2 jars of what was labeled as \"raw\" honey, expecting to enjoy its natural sweetness and health benefits. However, after a closer look and taste, I discovered that this honey was far from being raw and pure. Infact, it contained added sugars, which was extremely disappointing.One of the first things I noticed was the honey\\'s overly smooth texture. Raw honey typically has a thicker consistency with natural crystallization and variations in texture due to its unprocessed nature. However, this honey poured out effortlessly and lacked the richness that raw honey should possess.Upon tasting it, I was surprised by the intense sweetness that seemed unnatural for raw honey. Authentic raw honey has a balanced sweetness with subtle floral and herbal notes, but this product tasted more like syrup with a cloying sweetness that lingered on the palate.Further investigation into the ingredients list revealed that this honey contained added sugars, which explained its overly sweet and uniform taste. This was a clear deception, as raw honey should contain only one ingredient: honey from bees.Moreover, the packaging and labeling were misleading, prominently displaying \"raw\" honey without any mention of added sugars or processing methods. As a consumer looking for natural and healthy products, I felt cheated and misled by this deceptive marketing tactic. This product is not recommended for consumption.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n          5 people found this helpful\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Sign in to filter reviews\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n        \\n            15,826 total ratings, 3,647 with reviews\\n        \\n    \\n    \\n\\n\\nThere was a problem filtering reviews right now.

In the last few purchases, I have encountered minor issues like receiving an old batch of honey, resulting in excess crystallisation, etc. Brands need to focus more on the quality of procurement\\n        \\n\\n\\n                Images in this review \\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Helpful\\n\\n\\nReport\\n\\nShowing 0 comments\\nThere was a problem loading comments right now.

'list'>\n","[Document(page_content=\"[Music] all healing comes from inside ourselves we have the pH on the outside and the pH on the inside and all healing is based on love we really don't understand our own power see I have this kind of idea that when God created this Earth whoever God is to whoever you are created the Earth and it was beautiful and everything was in place and the way it should be but then he created the human being and he said to us now you are the only creatures that have the right to choose and have free will so therefore I give you dominion over the Earth and we decided that what he meant by Dominion was dominance and so we've taken over the Earth and done what we darn well choosed with with it and look where we are so it's that reality the inner part of us we're all reaching for our true humanity and that true Humanity understands that we are the ones who do the healing see I have I've come up with what I call five LS the first one is life and love without life there's nothing you know you can be a a seed in the Great Pyramid for 5,000 years and no nothing happens until love which is light and water and so on softens the shell and the seed opens up and it grows life and love are one unit they work together it's like a pregnancy when a mother is pregnant she and that baby are one unit they what she eats the baby eats what she thinks the baby thinks it's a constant process but that aspect of reality that is that baby that is being nurtured and and grown within the womb doesn't really find its own identity until it takes its first breath so it's this reality that life and love are one unit as we work with each other that way we can really understand aspects of ourselves but aspects of the world around us and aspects of other people too the first L was life and love so those two came together and I understood those but the third one was laughter laughter without love is cruel it's mean it it takes families apart it has caused Wars you know laughter can be cruel but laughter with love is joy and [Music] happiness the fourth L is labor labor without love is drudgery you just got to go to work you just got to do this but labor with Love Is Bliss it's why you singers sing why painters paint it's why I do what I do it's why you do what you do it's what makes our heart sing it's that inner aspect of our being that comes Al lives and and we'll work five times as hard as we were when we were dragging ourselves along with the drudgery thing and the fifth one is listening listening without love is empty sound it just doesn't make any sense you you don't understand but listening with love is understanding so these five elves have been very helpful for me in structuring and understanding the the philosophy and the life that I'm working with and and you've been a teacher you've you've been a doctor but you've been writing books and you've just put out a new book The the well-lived life where you share six Secrets what do you hope people learn from that book I hope they really understand love being the teacher and love being the essence of healing my spirit needs to Bear witness with thy Spirit we need to let the energy of our being move and help and as we help others we help ourselves it's that life flow that is so essential spend time looking for what I call the light you know I kind of see myself walking along with a flashlight in the dark on my path and it's dark and I can just go as far as my flashlight takes me but as I'm walking along sometimes there's a on the side of the path there's a light that is not very bright it's just kind of shimmering if I shine my light over there all of a sudden that light becomes great in other words as we reach out for each other just with whatever we have whatever the opportunity is and you use it and you work forward with it you're helping people in ways that you know not I understand that you had a chance to meet one of History's Greatest teachers you met Gandhi at one point can you tell me a little bit about that I was 10 years old we were leaving India we were in the train and leaving RI to go to Bombay and I was really sad cuz I didn't want to leave India and I knew I had to and so I'm I'm sitting in the train with my face plastered against the window really looking out in India there always crowds of people well there were crowds of people here but the there was a man walking in front of this crowd and he had on a toy and a staff and I recognized him as Gandhi and he was just walking along and when he it came into my sight and he reached down a little girl was handing him a flower he took the flower and he as he looked up he looked straight into my eyes and I looked into his and something happened I can't explain to you what happened I can't explain to anybody I can't even explain it to myself but I felt a connection of love that was really really important to me that that was just a moment I watched him go on with the Salt March that he was doing and so on 30 years later my parents were working with Gandhi as India was torn apart with the the partition Hindus and muhammads and killing each it was just awful and uh my parents had their little medical Jeep and they took it around to camps and did what they could when Gandhi was speaking my dad would get up on on the platform with him and they would talk together to the people and Gandhi and my mother and father formed a friendship Gandhi gave my mother a cashmir blue Shaw and my dad a py putt blanket it was a close enough relationship in the family that this was being done so I feel that that spark was started when I was 10 years old and our family connection kept that going it's recognizing when something like that happens and not shoving it under the carpet because those are the things happen I've I've I've looked at people sometimes and been able to feel that and I don't even know who they are I recognize Gandhi but there are a lot of people that are who seem lost and so on and if you can smile at them and speak to them and and recognize them people are waiting to be [Music] recognized that's what Gandhi did when he looked at me and I looked at him I recognized him and he recognized me and that's still with me this ability to to really recognize each other as real people living beings that are in the same world as we are that love flows and love has to keep on flowing or it dies what do you hope your legacy is that love is what really matters when you get down to the basic Center aspect of what healing is all about it's about love and life\",

These models help in determining the likelihood of a borrower\\ndefaulting on a loan. Regulatory bodies have established various rules to ensure that these models\\nare developed and used responsibly, enhancing the stability and integrity of the financial system.\\nSome of the key regulatory rules include:\\n1. Basel Accords: The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has developed a series of\\nregulatory frameworks, known as the Basel Accords (Basel I, II, and III), which set out the minimum\\ncapital requirements for banks based on the riskiness of their assets. The frameworks require banks\\nto maintain a certain level of capital reserve based on the credit risk assessed by their internal\\nmodels.\\n2. Model Validation and Governance: Regulators require that banks and financial institutions have\\nrobust governance structures in place for the development, implementation, and ongoing validation\\nof their credit risk models. This includes periodic review and testing to ensure that models are\\nperforming as expected and accurately reflecting the risk profile of the borrowers.\\n3. Data Quality and Management: Financial institutions must ensure that the data used in credit risk\\nmodels is accurate, complete, and relevant. This includes requirements for data collection,\\nprocessing, and storage, as well as for the management of data quality and integrity.\\n4. Stress Testing: Banks are required to conduct stress tests to assess the impact of adverse\\neconomic scenarios on their loan portfolios. These tests help in understanding the potential for\\nlosses under extreme but plausible conditions and ensure that the bank has adequate capital', metadata={'source': 'Regulatory_Rules_in_Credit_Risk_Models.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='reserves to withstand such shocks.\\n5. Disclosure and Transparency: Regulations require banks to disclose information about their credit\\nrisk assessment practices, model parameters, and risk management strategies. This transparency\\nhelps in promoting market discipline and allows stakeholders to better understand the risk profile of\\nthe institution.\\n6. Fair Lending Practices: Credit risk models must comply with fair lending laws and regulations,\\nwhich are designed to prevent discrimination against borrowers based on race, gender, age, or\\nother protected characteristics. This includes requirements for the fair and equitable treatment of all\\nborrowers throughout the lending process.\\nThese regulatory rules are critical in ensuring that credit risk models are developed and used in a\\nmanner that promotes financial stability, protects consumers, and fosters trust in the banking\\nsystem.', metadata={'source': 'Regulatory_Rules_in_Credit_Risk_Models.pdf', 'page': 1})]\n"]}],"source":["from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader\n","\n","!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/venkatareddykonasani/Datasets/master/Regulatory_Rules_in_Credit_Risk_Models/Regulatory_Rules_in_Credit_Risk_Models.pdf\n","loader=PyPDFLoader(file_path=\"Regulatory_Rules_in_Credit_Risk_Models.pdf\")\n","pdf_file_data=loader.load()\n","print(type(pdf_file_data))\n","print(pdf_file_data)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OudffB9CuBFY"},"source":["# HTML Loader"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wqMf-sW-hquN","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"collapsed":true,"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717046732530,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12689,"user":{"displayName":"Charles Theophilus","userId":"16523271150675086603"}},"outputId":"acf3a7f2-4032-4b83-ac5f-cc667af1c371"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.12.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: soupsieve>1.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from beautifulsoup4) (2.5)\n"]}],"source":["!pip install beautifulsoup4"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"6K-G5vK0icIM"},"outputs":[],"source":["from langchain.document_loaders import BSHTMLLoader"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"NO8KOJ07icQD","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"collapsed":true,"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717046734566,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":732,"user":{"displayName":"Charles Theophilus","userId":"16523271150675086603"}},"outputId":"54ad381d-ff1c-44c7-8975-1ee74ad0dd56"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--2024-05-30 05:25:33--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/venkatareddykonasani/Datasets/master/Word_bank_news_html/South_Asia_Global_Debt_Summary.html\n","Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.108.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.110.133, ...\n","Connecting to raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)|185.199.108.133|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 2435 (2.4K) [text/plain]\n","Saving to: ‘South_Asia_Global_Debt_Summary.html’\n","\n","\r          South_Asi   0%[                    ]       0  --.-KB/s               \rSouth_Asia_Global_D 100%[===================>]   2.38K  --.-KB/s    in 0s      \n","\n","2024-05-30 05:25:33 (31.9 MB/s) - ‘South_Asia_Global_Debt_Summary.html’ saved [2435/2435]\n","\n","<class 'list'>\n","[Document(page_content=\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary - South Asia's Growing Role in Global Debt\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary: Unpacking South Asia’s Growing Role in Global Debt\\n\\n        The South Asia Region (SAR), comprising eight countries, represents a significant portion of the world’s population and carries a growing share of global debt.

In 2020, Oracle was the third-largest software company in the world by revenue and market capitalization. In 2023, the company’s seat in Forbes Global 2000 was 80. The company sells database software (particularly the Oracle Database) and cloud computing. Oracle\\'s core application software is a suite of enterprise software products, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, human capital management (HCM) software, customer relationship management (CRM) software, enterprise performance management (EPM) software, Customer Experience Commerce (CX Commerce) and supply chain management (SCM) software.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nLarry Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL). Ellison took inspiration from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.\" He heard about the IBM System R database from an article in the IBM Research Journal provided by Oates. Ellison wanted to make Oracle\\'s product compatible with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979, then again to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1983, to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. The name also drew from the 1977 CIA project codename, which was also Oracle\\'s first customer. At this stage, Bob Miner served as the company\\'s senior programmer. On March 12, 1986, the company had its initial public offering.\\nIn 1989, Oracle moved its world headquarters to the Redwood Shores neighborhood of Redwood City, California, though its campus was not completed until 1995.\\nIn 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation, officially named Oracle, but is sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company.\\nOracle acquired the following technology companies:\\n\\nPeopleSoft (2005), an ERP company\\nSiebel (2006), a CRM company\\nBEA Systems (2008), an enterprise infrastructure software company\\nSun Microsystems (2010), a computer hardware and software company (noted for its Java programming language).\\nOn July 15, 2013, Oracle transferred its stock listing from the Nasdaq to the NYSE. At the time, it was the largest-ever U.S. market transfer.\\nIn an effort to compete with Amazon Web Services and its products, Oracle announced in 2019 it was partnering with former rival Microsoft. The alliance called that Oracle Cloud and Microsoft Azure would be directly connected, allowing customers of each to store data on both cloud computing platforms and run software on either Oracle or Azure. Some saw this not only as an attempt to compete with Amazon but also with Google and Salesforce, which acquired Looker and Tableau Software, respectively.\\nOn December 11, 2020, Oracle announced that it was moving its world headquarters from Redwood Shores to Austin, Texas.\\nOn December 20, 2021, Oracle announced the acquisition of Cerner, a health information technology company. The next day, on December 21, Oracle made public the acquisition of Federos, an AI and automation tools company for network performance. The acquisition of Cerner was completed on June 8, 2022, for $28.3 billion in cash. On March 31, 2020, Oracle announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire LiveData Utilities. The acquisition extends Oracle Utilities\\' Network Management System by adding a long-standing partner that provides leading operational technology (OT) middleware solutions and SCADA capabilities to monitor and control utility equipment while reducing the complexity of real-time systems. In October 2022, Oracle completed the acquisition of certain assets of Smartvid.io, Inc. (d/b/a Newmetrix).
